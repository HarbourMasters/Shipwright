# Welcome to the Ship of Harkinian!

A PC port of OoT allowing you to enjoy the game with modern controls, widescreen, high-resolution, gyroscopy and other great features! Setup is simple, let's get started!

The Ship does not include assets and as such requires a prior copy of the game to play.

## Quick Start

1) Download The Ship of Harkinian from Discord.
2) Requires an `oot debug` rom (not Master Quest).
```
Build team: `zelda@srd022j`
Build date: `03-02-21 00:49:18` (year-month-day)
sha1: cee6bc3c2a634b41728f2af8da54d9bf8cc14099
```
3) Use the OTRGui to generate an `oot.otr` archive file.
4) Launch `soh.exe`

Congratulations, you are now sailing with the Ship of Harkinian! Have fun!

## Additional Setup Information

The Ship of Harkinian uses a proprietary versioning system consisting of a sci-fi film character followed by a phonetic alphabet code word. The film character represents a major release version which increments with the addition of many new features and bug fixes. The code word represents a minor release version which increments with small updates mainly comprised of bug fixes. For example, `DECKARD ALFA`.

### The Extraction Tool

* Open a rom to initiate generating the `oot.otr` archive file.
* If a second button exists then `oot.otr` already exists. To prevent overwriting the old `oot.otr` use this button to choose a new game directory. The new directory must not already contain an `oot.otr` to prevent an error.
* When the process completes, place `oot.otr` beside `soh.exe` if it is not already.

This packaging process can take up to **5 minutes**.

Close the OTRGui when the `Done!` message appears.
If you get another message, then you might have selected the wrong rom. Make sure to use a rom consistent with the above checksum.

If you still cannot get the tool to work, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/BtBmd55HVH) and ask for help in the `#support` text channel. Keep-in-mind that we do not condone piracy in any way.

### Running The Ship of Harkinian

Launch the game. If the window immediately closes, or if there are visual artifacts, you may have selected the wrong rom in the OTRGui tool. 

Currently, DirectX 11 and OpenGL is supported. Change the renderer by opening the `shipofharkinian.ini` configuration file in notepad and add `sdl` to `gfx backend` for OpenGL or leave blank for DirectX.

## Building The Ship of Harkinian

 1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.2/python-3.10.2-amd64.exe)
 2. Install [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
 2b. In the Visual Studio Installer, install `MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++`.
 4. Clone the Ship of Harkinian repository.
 5. Put your 2020 OoT debug rom in the `soh` folder.
 6. Launch `soh/fixbaserom.py`.
 7. Launch `soh/extract_baserom.py`.
 8. Copy the `baserom` folder from the `soh` folder into the `OTRExporter` folder.
 9. Run `OTRExporter/OTRExporter.sln`.
 10. Switch the solution to `Release x64`.
 11. Build the solution. 
 12. Launching `OTRExporter/extract_assets.py` will generate an `oot.otr` archive file in `OTRExporter/oot.otr`.
 13. Run `soh/soh.sln`
 14. Switch the solution to `Release x86`.
 15. Build the solution.
 16. Copy the `OTRExporter/oot.otr` archive file to `soh/Release`.
 17. Launch `soh.exe`.

## Troubleshooting The Exporter
- Affirm that you have an `/assets` folder filled with XMLs in the same directory as OTRGui.exe
- Affirm that `zapd.exe` exists in the `/assets/extractor` folder
