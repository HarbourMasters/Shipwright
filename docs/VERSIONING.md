## About Versions

The Ship of Harkinian's versioning system is a unique system, comprising of a three-numbered version (`x.y.z`) and a version codename.  The main version number `x` signifies major feature updates that require a new `oot.otr` file.  The version number `y` signifies major feature updates and bugfixes that do not require a new `oot.otr` file.  The version number `z` signifies minor updates such as a collection of bugfixes.

The version codename consists of a sci-fi film character followed by a phonetic alphabet code word. The film character represents a major release version which increments with the major `x` or `y` version bumps. The code word represents a minor release version which increments with the minor `z` version bump.
