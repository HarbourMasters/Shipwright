// Trick names and descriptions obtained from https://github.com/OoTRandomizer/OoT-Randomizer/blob/Dev/SettingsList.py with additions and edits
// Difficulties initially decided on personal opinions, will be updated based on community feedback. todo: update glitch difficulties
// Novice - if you were told X is possible, then you would be likely be able to do it either first time or it is something easily repeatable without any setup
// Intermediate - may take a few attempts or a small setup to achieve, or is an easily repeatable trick with a small frame window
// Advanced - may have a tight time window to achieve, have a long setup, or small frame window to perform
// Expert - typically a series of small frame windows or longer setups, likely to require buffering
// Extreme - this may require several frame perfect tricks, long setups or heavy reliance on environment to perform
// Experimental - not implemented; these tricks may let you put the game into a softlockable state
// Please see https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqsXSioZwQyoa23_27l5NZq5IZdKRi5Sm for reference on performing several of these tricks
